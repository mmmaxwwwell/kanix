## T076 — Initialize Flutter admin app with Riverpod + Dio + GoRouter
- Nixpkgs Flutter ships `flutter_tester` without execute permission — the `flake.nix` shellHook creates a patched symlink farm at `.flutter-patched/` and sets `FLUTTER_ROOT`; CI/headless agents must replicate this or `flutter test` fails with a permissions error
- SuperTokens admin auth uses cookie-based sessions; for Flutter web Dio handles cookies automatically, for non-web platforms extract `st-access-token` from signin response headers and send as `Authorization: Bearer` header via an interceptor
- GoRouter `redirect` callback fires on every navigation — watch the auth state via Riverpod so the router recreates when auth changes, redirecting unauthenticated users to `/login` and authenticated users away from it

## T077 — Implement admin dashboard screen
- `FutureProvider.autoDispose` with `.overrideWith((_) => Future.value(data))` is the clean way to mock async data in widget tests — avoids Dio's pending timers which fail `flutter_test`'s invariant checks
- Flutter test default surface is 800x600; with padding and grid layout, card cells can be as small as ~200x80 — use `mainAxisSize: MainAxisSize.min` and compact text styles (`bodySmall` not `titleSmall`) to avoid RenderFlex overflow in tests

## T078 — Implement admin order management screens
- For complex screens with TabBar, DataTable, and dialogs, set `tester.view.physicalSize = Size(1920, 1080)` and `devicePixelRatio = 1.0` in widget tests to avoid RenderFlex overflow on the default 800x600 surface — always call `addTearDown(() => tester.view.resetPhysicalSize())`
- `DropdownButtonFormField` requires a `Material` ancestor — when testing screens that use it outside the app's `Scaffold` shell, wrap in `Scaffold(body: ...)` in the test
- `FutureProvider.autoDispose.family` providers can be overridden per-key in tests: `orderDetailProvider('order-1').overrideWith((_) => Future.value(order))` — useful for testing detail screens with specific IDs

## T079 — Implement admin fulfillment + shipment screens
- `FLUTTER_ROOT` must point to the patched symlink farm at `.flutter-patched/` when running `flutter test` outside the nix devshell — the shell hook sets this automatically but headless agents need `FLUTTER_ROOT="$(pwd)/.flutter-patched"`
- When writing `show` imports for files that export both a list screen and detail screen (e.g., `FulfillmentScreen, FulfillmentDetailScreen`), the router file must explicitly name both classes in the `show` clause
- `StreamProvider.autoDispose<WsMessage>` for real-time updates can be defined in the screen file itself (not just provider files) — keeps WebSocket subject filtering co-located with the UI that consumes it

## T080 — Implement admin inventory + product screens
- `DropdownButtonFormField` `value` parameter is deprecated since Flutter 3.33; use `initialValue` instead to set the initial form field value
- Private widgets like `_ProductStatusChip` should not declare `super.key` — private classes cannot be subclassed externally, so the `key` parameter triggers `unused_element_parameter` warning
- `FutureProvider.autoDispose.family` can be chained for detail+adjustments on the same screen — watch both providers and invalidate both on WebSocket updates for consistent state

## T081 — Implement admin support + dispute screens
- DataTable with 7+ columns overflows on 800x600 test surface — set `tester.view.physicalSize = Size(1920, 1080)` for all tests that render data rows (not just detail screens)
- Dart 3.x `unnecessary_underscores` lint: use `(_, _)` not `(_, __)` for unused parameters — double underscore is no longer needed for disambiguation
- `ListView.separated` in a message thread needs an `Expanded` parent to get unbounded height constraints — without it, the ListView will throw "Vertical viewport was given unbounded height"

## T082 — Implement admin settings + contributor management screens
- `DefaultTabController` with `TabBar` + `TabBarView` works well for settings screens with multiple sections — wrap in `Column` with `Expanded` around `TabBarView` to avoid unbounded height
- When replacing a placeholder screen (e.g. `CustomersScreen` → `ContributorsScreen`), update all three: the router import/route, the `AppShell` navigation label, and the `_routes` list for index mapping

## T083 — Initialize Flutter customer app with Riverpod + Dio + GoRouter
- Customer auth flow adds signup + email verification on top of admin's login-only flow — GoRouter redirect must handle three states (unauthenticated, pendingVerification, authenticated) and route to `/login`, `/verify-email`, or `/catalog` accordingly
- Customer app uses `NavigationBar` (bottom nav, mobile-first) instead of admin's `NavigationRail` — map non-tab routes (e.g. `/product`, `/checkout`, `/support`) to their parent tab index in `_selectedIndex` for correct highlight
- `AsyncNotifier` subclass overrides work well for test mocking: `authStateProvider.overrideWith(() => _MockAuthNotifier())` where the mock only overrides `build()` to return a fixed `AuthState`
