# Learnings

Discoveries, gotchas, and decisions recorded by the implementation agent across runs.

---

## T090 — Implement SSG product catalog pages
- Astro SSG product pages must gracefully handle missing API (`PUBLIC_API_URL` not set) — `fetchProducts()` returns `[]` so the build succeeds with an empty catalog and a "Coming Soon" placeholder
- Product-to-module STL viewer matching uses slug substring matching (`product.slug.includes(mod.slug)`) since product slugs may contain the module slug plus a material suffix (e.g. `waste-bag-dispenser-tpu`)
- OpenGraph meta tags added to `Base.astro` via optional props (`ogImage`, `ogType`, `canonicalUrl`) — all existing pages get default OG tags without changes since the new props have sensible defaults

## T091 — Implement guest checkout as Astro islands
- Astro checkout uses vanilla JS `<script>` tags (not React/Vue islands) since the project has no framework integration — Astro bundles these into separate JS files in `_astro/`, so integration tests checking for inline JS strings must also grep the bundled files
- The API's `POST /api/checkout` combines shipping calc + tax calc + Stripe PaymentIntent creation in one call, returning `client_secret` — the checkout flow is: address form → checkout API → show totals → Stripe `confirmPayment()` → redirect to confirmation
- Stripe.js loaded from CDN (`js.stripe.com/v3/`) with the Payment Element (not Card Element) for PCI compliance — uses `appearance: { theme: "night" }` to match the dark Kanix theme

## T092 — Implement kit builder page
- Kit builder uses the public `GET /api/kits` endpoint (from T085's `findActiveKitsWithDetails`) which returns kit definitions with nested requirements, product classes, products, and variant-level inventory — no auth required
- Kit variant selection UI uses `data-class-id` attributes on buttons to scope selections per class, with CSS class toggling for selected state (`border-amber-500 bg-amber-500/10`) — savings calculated client-side as `sum(individual prices) - kit price`
- The `POST /api/cart/kits` endpoint expects `{ kit_definition_id, selections: [{ product_class_id, variant_id }] }` and returns `{ kit, cart }` — the cart library's `addKitToCart` auto-creates a cart if no token exists (same pattern as `addToCart`)

## T093 — Add contributions model page
- Astro content pages (contributions, warranty, etc.) are pure static pages — no API data fetching needed, just use the Base layout with matching nav/footer patterns from index.astro
- Royalty spec details are spread across FR-069 through FR-076 — the key numbers are: 10% royalty at 25-unit threshold (retroactive), 20% for 501(c)(3) donation option, 50-unit starter kit milestone

## T094 — Add warranty, returns, and care instructions pages
- Material temperature thresholds already defined in `MATERIAL_WARNINGS` in `site/src/data/products.ts` — reuse these values (TPU 60°C, TPC 130°C, PLA 50°C, PETG 80°C, ABS 100°C) for consistency across warranty and care pages
- Footer links must be added to every page individually since there's no shared footer component — 10 pages total needed updating (7 existing + 3 new)

## T095 — Update README with contributions model
- T093 already added the full Contributions Model section to README (milestones table, contributions page link, CLA instructions) — T095 was redundant and required no code changes

## T095a — Add nix-mcp-debugkit flake input + re-export packages + config writers
- Config writers use `pkgs.writeTextFile` with `destination` to produce a directory containing `mcp/*.json` — `nix build .#mcp-android-config` outputs a store path with `mcp/android.json` inside it
- MCP config JSON pins commands to Nix store paths via string interpolation (`"${mcp-android}/bin/mcp-android"`) so the config is reproducible and doesn't rely on PATH

## T095b — Register MCP servers + required permissions in `.claude/settings.json`
- MCP server registrations go in `.mcp.json` (project root), not in `.claude/settings.json` — the settings schema does not accept `mcpServers` directly
- `enableAllProjectMcpServers: true` in settings.json auto-approves all servers from `.mcp.json` so agents don't get prompted

## T095c — KVM + emulator prereq verification + backend setup/teardown scripts
- `kvm-ok` is not always installed (not in the Nix devshell); the prereqs script falls back to checking `/dev/kvm` readability when `kvm-ok` is unavailable
- Astro dev server default port is 4321 (not 3000) — setup.sh uses `--port 4321` explicitly to avoid conflicts with the API on port 3000
- `pg_ctl start` is idempotent-safe (returns 0 even if already running) making the setup script re-runnable without killing existing services first

## T095d — APK install + app launch scripts consumed by MCP runner
- Flutter app package IDs follow `com.kanix.kanix_admin` / `com.kanix.kanix_customer` pattern (not `com.kanix.admin`) — defined in `android/app/build.gradle.kts` as `applicationId`
- Debug APK output path is `build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-debug.apk` relative to each Flutter project root
- `adb shell am force-stop` before `am start` ensures a cold start; idempotent since force-stop on an uninstalled package is a no-op

## T095e — Set up Playwright + Patrol regression harnesses
- Playwright JSON reporter configured via `PW_JSON_OUTPUT` env var — defaults to `../test-logs/e2e/playwright-results.json` relative to site dir; Patrol uses `flutter test --machine` to emit JSON
- Patrol Android setup requires both `MainActivityTest.java` with `@RunWith(PatrolJUnitRunner.class)` in `androidTest/` AND `testInstrumentationRunner` in `build.gradle.kts` `defaultConfig`
- Site uses pnpm (not npm) for dependency management — `pnpm add -D @playwright/test` installs correctly; CI workflow uses `npm ci` since `package-lock.json` may be expected by the workflow

## T200 — Harden db/db.integration.test.ts
- The old test used `describe.skip` via `describeWithDb` when `DATABASE_URL` was unset — replaced with `requireDatabaseUrl()` from `test-helpers.ts` which throws loudly in `beforeAll`
- `postgres.js` `sql.end()` makes subsequent template-tag queries throw — use `conn.sql\`SELECT 1\`` (not `conn.db.execute()`) to test post-close failure since drizzle's `execute()` needs a proper SQL object
- `createDatabaseConnection` with an unreachable URL doesn't throw until the first query — `checkDatabaseConnectivity` returns `false` (catches internally), but raw `sql\`SELECT 1\`` throws

## T201 — Harden ready.integration.test.ts
- The `/ready` endpoint returns only `{ status, dependencies? }` — `uptime` and `version` are on `/health` (HealthResponse), not `/ready` (ReadyResponse)
- When `isReady()` is false (before `markReady()` or during shutdown), `/ready` short-circuits to 503 without checking dependencies — the response body has no `dependencies` field in this case
- The old test used `describeWithDb = DATABASE_URL ? describe : describe.skip` — replaced with `requireDatabaseUrl()` + `assertSuperTokensUp()` for loud failures

## T202 — Harden critical-path.integration.test.ts
- **SuperTokens singleton trap**: `initSuperTokens` uses `if (initialized) return;` — Phase 3's SIGTERM closes the DB connection captured by the singleton. Reordered tests so Phase 5/6 run before Phase 3 to avoid stale DB references.
- **verifySession bug fix**: The custom `verifySession` in `middleware.ts` passed raw Fastify request/reply to `Session.getSession()`, causing `getCookieValue is not a function` (500 error). Fixed by importing `FastifyRequest`/`FastifyResponse` wrappers from `supertokens-node/lib/build/framework/fastify/framework.js` and wrapping before calling `getSession`.
- **SuperTokens claim validators**: When using SuperTokens `Session.getSession` with proper wrappers, EmailVerification in REQUIRED mode causes 403 for unverified users. Must pass `overrideGlobalClaimValidators: () => []` since `requireVerifiedEmail` is a separate preHandler.
- **Public products API requires class membership**: `findActiveProductsWithDetails` filters products by `productClassMembership`. Test products without class membership won't appear in listings — use the detail endpoint (`/api/products/:slug`) instead, which has no class membership requirement.
- **Admin API responses use Drizzle camelCase**: Balance responses use `onHand`/`reserved`/`available` (not snake_case), and movement responses use `movementType`/`quantityDelta`.

## T203 — Harden auth/auth.integration.test.ts
- SuperTokens `signIn` returns 200 with `status: "WRONG_CREDENTIALS_ERROR"` (not HTTP 401) — test both wrong-password and non-existent-email to prevent enumeration
- Email verification uses `EmailVerification.createEmailVerificationToken` + `verifyEmailUsingToken` server-side; must re-sign-in after verification to get a session with the verified claim
- Rate limit test needs a separate server instance with `RATE_LIMIT_MAX: 3` to avoid polluting the main test server's request counter

## T205 — Harden auth/email-conflict.integration.test.ts
- SuperTokens `signUpPOST` override `input.formFields` values are typed `unknown` — cast to `string` for drizzle `ilike()`
- For consistent enumeration defense, both the pre-signup customer-table check AND the SuperTokens `EMAIL_ALREADY_EXISTS_ERROR` path must return the same `GENERAL_ERROR` / `ERR_EMAIL_CONFLICT` response shape
- `ilike()` from drizzle-orm handles case-insensitive matching against the `text` column in Postgres without needing `citext` extension

## T206 — Harden auth/github-link.integration.test.ts
- Mock GitHub user IDs must be unique per run (use `Date.now()` offsets) — hardcoded IDs like `12345` or `99001` collide with data from prior test runs since the shared Postgres instance isn't wiped between runs
- The test already used `createTestServer` with `serverOverrides: { githubUserFetcher }` to inject a mock GitHub API fetcher — this is the correct pattern for external API boundaries (mock the fetcher, not the DB/auth)
